==========
An <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> for you Android Device. You can define rules like "If an SMS from someone is received, ring the phone even if it's muted", or "If I have a calendar entry going on, mute the phone until that entry ends", and a lot more. It's highly expendable and you can define your own triggers and actions.

Currently Support (In progress)
